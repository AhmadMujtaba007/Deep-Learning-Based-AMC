## Deep Learning-Based Automatic Modulation Classification

### Overview:

This repository contains the code and documentation for my final year bachelor's project on automatic modulation classification using deep learning techniques. The project focuses on accurately classifying 12 modulated signals using state-of-the-art neural network architectures.

### Features:

- **Modulation Classification:** The core objective of this project is to automatically classify different modulated signals, enabling reliable identification of the modulation schemes employed in wireless communication.

- **Deep Learning Models:** The project leverages the power of deep neural networks to achieve high classification accuracy. Various architectures such as 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Hybrid  Neural Networks were explored and evaluated to determine the most effective model.

- **Dataset:** A diverse and comprehensive dataset of modulated signals was used for training and testing the models. The dataset includes a wide range of modulation types and signal-to-noise ratios, ensuring robustness and real-world applicability.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Rigorous data preprocessing techniques were applied to clean, normalize, and augment the dataset, enhancing the model's ability to generalize across different scenarios.

- **Model Training and Evaluation:** The project includes code for model training, validation, and evaluation. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed to assess the model's performance comprehensively.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The repository provides a user-friendly interface for users to input their own modulated signals and obtain classification results using the trained deep learning models.
